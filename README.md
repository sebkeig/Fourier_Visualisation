This is some butchered refactoring of initial code found here - https://github.com/Amritaryal44/drawing-with-DFT-and-epicycle/tree/master
I think there is a fundamental issue with the maths in the original code, as there shouldn't be upper limit on resolution (but adding harmonics (or order) of over 100 causes issues) 
I also have not been able to find an effective way to order coefficients by magnitude.
